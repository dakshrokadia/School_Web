                                <p>Mountain Biking is an adventurous sport that involves a person who rides a bike down trails. There are many different types of trails such as: flow which is smooth, techy which is rocky and jump trails which have lots of gaps, there are many more in between. Mountain Biking - also abbreviated with MTB - is very broad in terms of competitions and has many different types competitions and races some competitions are endurance related and can be very excruciating whereas other competitions can be more about tricks that are performed. The following is about my experience with Mountain Biking.</p>

                                <p>I started Mountain Biking when I was about 11 and got gifted a very old bike from the 90s. It was very heavy and quite frankly not the best but it did the job. My friend and I decided to go on some random dirt paths in a forest near our house. Unknowningly, we were riding 'illegal' trails which are trails not made to regulation. Months later we found out there was a place up the hill which had many many many Mountain Bike trails so Many and good where people come all around New Zealand to ride. Whakarewarewa forest was the name of the forest it had lots of different types of trails from trails with lots of flow and smooth to very rocky and harsh terrain. Little did I know there was more to the world of moutain biking that was hiding in the forest. There was a full sized bmx racing course. It was massive and had massive jumps and berms (which are sloped turns). It also had a very well maintained slopestyle course on the side which also had massive jumps. This changed my view and was like a dream come true.</p>

                                <p>I have made many friendships from Mountain Biking and have experienced so many things. From the photo are my friends: Harry, Tyler, And me. Behind us is the trail we are about to ride and the forest. Though I look a bit akward in the photo its one of my best memories and a really good photo. If it wasnt for my friends I probably wouldn't have continued the sport.</p>

                                <p>Mountain Biking may seem as you need alot of strength but you also need alot of endurance as the climbs to the top are the real test. Some climbs can take from 15 minutes all the way to 2 or 3 hours. The Longer the climb the better the way down. Makara peak - photo on the right - takes about 1 hour to climb, depending on breaks and climb speed. On this climb there is a jump area which is shown on the photo below, which is a fun break. Going up the hill may look easy but depending on the path it can be very steep. There are many differnt categories of mountain biking such as: Downhill, Enduro, and cross country. You need good fitness for mountain biking and the correct mindset.</p>
