                                <p>I started Mountain Biking when I was about 11 and got gifted a very old bike from the 90s. It was very heavy and quite frankly not the best but it did the job. My friend and I decided to go on some random dirt paths in a forest near our house. Unknowningly, we were riding 'illegal' trails which are trails not made to regulation. Months later we found out there was a place up the hill which had many many many Mountain Bike trails so Many and good where people come all around New Zealand to ride. Whakarewarewa forest was the name of the forest it had lots of different types of trails from trails with lots of flow and smooth to very rocky and harsh terrain. Little did I know there was more to the world of moutain biking that was hiding in the forest. There was a full sized bmx racing course. It was massive and had massive jumps and berms (which are sloped turns). It also had a very well maintained slopestyle course on the side which also had massive jumps. This Changed my View and was like a dream come true.</p>
