			<h3>My Family</h1>
			<p>I have a relatively medium sized family. Consisting of my:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hardik - Dad</li>
				<li>Janki - Mum</li>
				<li>Daksh - me</li>
				<li>jenik - Little brother</li>
			</ol>
			<p>My dad Owns Dominos Porirua and spends most of his time there. My mum usually stays home and makes food, does home duties and goes to the gym. My brother plays games all day and is <strong>always</strong> annoying. Our family is usually calm but when all 4 members are present there is chaos.</p>

			<h3>All About Me</h3>
			<p>I love computers, it is my passion, not playing games but tinkering with software and hardware. I love programming in my free time. I usually use Python as i find it more enjoying than html/css as there is it more complex. I also like opening and fixing computers and reinstalling operating systems and creating virtual machines.</p>
			<p>My favourite sports are football/futsal and the goat of all sports - Mountain Biking. My favorite trail is Split Enz which is a very long trail and takes about 2 hours to get to if using the bus/shuttle half way, or 3 hours without.</p>
			<p>Mountain Biking, Soccer and Computers are my 3 best interests.</p>
